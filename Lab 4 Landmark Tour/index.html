            <p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheater in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72, and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81â€“96). The three emperors who were responsible for building the Colosseum are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).</p>
